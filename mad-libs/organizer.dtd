<!--
	Organizer file - an arbitrary, sofisticated way to organize data.
	Data elements are defined by themselves; they can be out of scope
	if they are inside a group. Multiple groups can contain a single
	data element through the attribute "members", but only if it is
	in the same scope level or higher scope level.
	Note that the capibilities of this file format are really only
	useful if you use an editor for them, since this file format is
	made to ease the effort of complex data organizations.
